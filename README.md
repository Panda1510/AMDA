# Aversarial-Multiple--Domain-Adaptation-for-Fault-Diagnosis
### This is an implementation  of single source multiple target domain adaptation for fault diagnosis
- We conducted the experiements on two rela world datasets for fault diagnosis: CWRU dataset and KAt dataset.
- You can download CWRU dataset from this link https://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/welcome-case-western-reserve-university-bearing-data-center-website
- You can download KAt dataset from this link https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download/

### Reprodunce the results:
1. Clone the repository 
2. Download the fault diagnosis datsets. 
3. Use the provided datapreprocessing codes to prepare the data for experimeting. 
4. Run AMDA (1SmT).
