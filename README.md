# Aversarial-Multiple-Domain-Adaptation-for-Fault-Diagnosis
### This is an implementation of â€œAdversarial Multiple-TargetDomain Adaptation for Fault Diagnosis" (Accepted at IEEE Transaction on Instrumentation and Measurements) 
- We conducted the experiements on two real datasets for fault diagnosis problem: CWRU dataset and KAt dataset.
- You can download CWRU dataset from this link https://csegroups.case.edu/bearingdatacenter/pages/welcome-case-western-reserve-university-bearing-data-center-website
- You can download KAt dataset from this link https://mb.uni-paderborn.de/kat/forschung/datacenter/bearing-datacenter/data-sets-and-download/

### Reprodunce the results:
1. Clone the repository 
2. Download the fault diagnosis datsets. 
3. Use the provided datapreprocessing codes to process the data. 
4. Run AMDA (1SmT).
